    "market_narrative": "The economic data paints a mixed picture of a US economy showing signs of manufacturing weakness and moderating inflation pressures, potentially supporting a 'soft landing' narrative where growth slows without tipping into recession. The Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index's sharp deterioration signals ongoing challenges in the industrial sector, which could pressure corporate earnings and investor sentiment. However, the Nasdaq's strong rebound driven by AI stocks suggests tech optimism persists, buoyed by potential policy shifts like extended Obamacare subsidies and tariff discussions under the new administration. Market pundits are debating whether this confirms a reflationary trend with selective strength in equities, or if sticky inflation and regional manufacturing declines point to broader economic fragility. News headlines validate this duality: AI-driven gains contrast with deficit concerns in Europe and tariff uncertainties, creating a narrative of cautious optimism for risk assets amid geopolitical tensions like Ukraine peace talks.",

        "bias": "BULLISH",
        "reasoning": "The Nasdaq's best day since May, fueled by Alphabet's AI rebound, signals tech sector resilience and investor confidence in innovation-driven growth. Upcoming data like Retail Sales and PPI forecasts suggest moderating inflation, potentially allowing for continued equity gains if earnings hold up despite manufacturing headwinds."

      "Bitcoin": {
        "bias": "BULLISH",
        "reasoning": "As a risk-on asset, BTC benefits from tech optimism and potential Fed easing implied by bill auction yield declines. Manufacturing weakness could drive safe-haven flows, but the overall narrative of selective economic strength and policy uncertainties (e.g., tariffs) positions BTC as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks, especially with Ukraine peace talk hopes."
      }
    },
    "trading_recommendation": "Monitor the upcoming PPI and Retail Sales releases for confirmation of inflation moderation; if data beats forecasts, consider long positions in ES futures to capitalize on tech momentum. For BTC, watch for volatility around manufacturing data—buy dips if broader market sentiment holds, targeting support at recent lows amid AI-driven equity strength."
